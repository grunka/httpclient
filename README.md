# HttpClient

_Simple HTTP client library on top of standard Java functionality_

Realized that I was replicating the same piece of code in many places, this is the result of trying to avoid that.

If you need something with more features or configurability you should probably take a look at [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org/) instead.
